ACCESSIBILITY IN TAILWIND

1. Hiding on Demand: not-sr-only Class
Now, let’s say you want to show the text for larger screens
but keep it hidden for smaller ones. The sr-only sm:not-sr-only
class combo is your ticket to this flex.


2. Creating Bridges to Inclusion
Tailwind’s accessibility utilities are like bridges that connect
all users to your content. 
With sr-only and not-sr-only, you’re weaving a tapestry
of inclusivity where everyone gets a front-row seat, no
matter how they experience your site.
