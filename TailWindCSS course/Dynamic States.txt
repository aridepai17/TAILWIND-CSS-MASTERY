DYNAMIC STATES

Tailwind CSS is your go-to toolkit for crafting stylish and
responsive interfaces with ease. But in today's world, where
interactivity and adaptability reign supreme, static designs
just won't cut it. Modern applications call for dynamic
responses to user interactions and varying screen sizes.

Forget the headaches of traditional CSS frameworks!
Tailwind CSS empowers you to effortlessly implement
dynamic element states by harnessing the magic of CSS
pseudo-selectors as prefixes to its intuitive classes. 

Need a captivating hover effect? Transform an element's
background on hover with a simple "hover" prefix:
<div class="bg-gray-500 hover:bg-blue-500 ... ">Hover Me</div>

But wait, there's more! Tailwind CSS extends its prowess
beyond just "hover".
It embraces an array of pseudo-selectors that grant you
incredible versatility. For those complex scenarios, meet the
mighty "group" class.

<div class="bg-blue-500 group ... ">
  <p class="text-blue-300 group-hover: text-white">
  Click for more
  </p>
</div>
