DARK MODE ENHANCEMENT

Tailwind CSS not only excels at responsive design but also
seamlessly integrates dark mode styling into your web
projects. With the dark mode variant, you can effortlessly
adapt your website's appearance when users switch to
dark mode.

Just like everything else, setting up and styling for dark and
light themes is easier than before.

To use dark mode, we need to make a small change. We
have to modify the configuration to include the dark class. 

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // ...
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}

If we don't specify it, the theme styles will automatically
adapt based on the user's Operating System preference â€“
quite interesting!
We only need to mention this field if we want to offer a
theme toggle on the website. It's a choice we make!

SOME IMPORTANT TERMS IN DARK MODE 

1. dark:bg-slate-800
This utility sets teh background color of the card to a darker shade, when dark mode is enabled.
This creates a visually distinct experience for users who prefer dark themes.

2. dark:text-white

Tailwind makes dark mode implementation hassle-free by

By incorporating these dark mode utilities, you enhance the
UX and demonstrate your attention to detail by providing a
design that adapts to different viewing preferences.
