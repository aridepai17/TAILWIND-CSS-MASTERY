TIPS AND TRICKS 

Now that you have understood, what tailwindcss is and how it works, let's explore a few tip nad tricks.

ACCENT 
Changes the default browser color for elements like checkboxes and radio groups.

<div class="my-4 flex flex-col">
  <label> <input type="checkbox" checked /> Browser Default </label>
  <label> <input type="checkbox" class="accent-pink-500" checked /> Accent Pink </label>
</div>


FLUID TEXTS
Usually, when building a responsive website, we have to take care of the text size on different devices. 
Something like this:

<p class="sm:text-7xl text-5xl">Something Nice</p>

Using the custom style approach we discussed and the min CSS function, we can do something like this:

<p class="text-[min(10vw,70px)]">Something Fluid</p>

The result, the second approach is much better and more responsive than the other. 
Instead of relying on the media screen, we kind of calculate the value depending on the
screen size automatically.


LESS JAVASCRIPT 
If you take the time to learn it well, you can perform certain tasks that are typically done using
JavaScript with tailwindcss alone, without requiring JavaScript. 


FILE 
If you worked with file inputs, you know the pain of stylingthe default layout.
Thankfully, Tailwindcss provides a better solution.
Use the file: prefix and use any utility to customize the input however you want.


HIGHLIGHT 
Do you want to override the default blue or other highlight that appears when a user selects a text on your website?
Tailwindcss’s selection is a way to go.

<div class="selection:bg-green-400 selection:text-white">

</div> 


CARET 
Not a fan of white or black caret? Use tailwindcss then,

<textarea class="w-full border border-zinc-300 caret-pink-500 p-2" placeholder="Type ..."></textarea>

Try typing it into textarea, and you’ll notice the caret color to be pink.


MANY MORE 
These are just a handful of examples. 
Tailwindcss offers many unique tools such as those for different states like before: & active:, styles that work only on certain screen sizes 
like landscape or portrait, styles for ARIA and screen readers, gradients animations, and it even lets you apply distinct styles when printing.
